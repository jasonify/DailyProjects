Very similar to last 180 Daily Projects but this time no set timeline

# Have Fun & Fail Often
## Big thing = to push self and fail... experiment with new tech.
### Go outide comfort zone

** Hybrid of art + engineering
** Start to finish but can be incremental for code side (reuse code or be small feature that is part of an app)
** Get inspired by looking at book collection + favorite sites  
** Publish online


** 30 mins art + 30 mins code
** aim for 3hrs++ a day. Ideally a lot more on weekends.
** should balance itself if one day is heavy on art, do next day heavy on code
