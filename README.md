Very similar to last 180 Daily Projects but this time no set timeline

# Have Fun & Fail Often
## Big thing = to push self and fail... experiment with new tech.
### Go outide comfort zone


** Focus will be more on the "creative / artistic" side and these should be
   mostly from start to finish (using some assets is okay but not the focus);

** Hybrid of art + engineering

** Start to finish but can be incremental for code side (reuse code or be small feature that is part of an app)

** Get inspired by looking at book collection + favorite sites  

** Publish online


** ideal: 30 mins art + 30 mins code

** aim for 3hrs++ a day. Ideally a lot more on weekends.

** should balance itself if one day is heavy on art, do next day heavy on code
